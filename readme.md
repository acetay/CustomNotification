OOP is Object-oriented Programming and is a set of principles. The actual practices of OOP takes on different form in different programming languages but they are 80% similar. Therefore, remember the concepts, and google/reference for the implementation.

In this lesson, we will:

### Quotes

> A static method is a class method and belongs to the class itself. This means you do not need an instance in order to use a static method. A non-static method is an instance method and belongs to each object that is generated from the class. - Excerpt from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/nail-your-java-interview-2)

> Instantiation: The new keyword is a Java operator that creates the object. Initialization: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object. - Excerpt from Oracle.com
